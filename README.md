HAkron 2017 Project - Python Pong!

This is my Pong Project for HAkron 2017. I used Python, version 2.7 as well as this tutorial: (http://trevorappleton.blogspot.com/2014/04/writing-pong-using-python-and-pygame.html) for
assistance for making this. I also edited the file using VIM on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
